# Introduction
Today you will get started with an API of your choice! For this assignment,  
the requirements are somewhat abstract, because you can fill in the entirety as you wish.  

# Requirements
1. As a user, I want to be invited to click a button when landing on the page.
2. As a user, I want to see 1 joke, tweet, or pokemon after clicking the button.
3. Check out at least 1 other feature of the API and make sure your user can use it (be creative!) :).
    - For example: DadJokes API can also retrieve pictures of dadjokes instead of text.
    - PokemonAPI: can also show the pokemon's strengths and weaknesses.


# Top Tips:
1. Test the API! Before building an entire app, see if you can do a simple GET request with Postman. What do you expect to get in return?
2. You may encounter a Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) error. See if and how you can solve this yourself before calling for help
3. Use the [API checklist](https://faq.wincacademy.nl/api-not-working-checklist/)

4. Some examples of APIs you can use:  
   - [Pokeapi](https://pokeapi.co/)
   - [API Documentation - tronalddump.io](https://docs.tronalddump.io/)
   - [icanhazdadjoke](https://icanhazdadjoke.com/api#fetch-a-random-dad-joke)
